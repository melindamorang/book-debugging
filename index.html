                <p>Hi. I'm Melinda. I can help you debug your book.</p>

                <p>Wait, what?</p>

                <p>In software engineering, debugging is the process of stepping through your code line by line to
                    identify problems.
                    What's causing an incorrect result, an error, or a crash? How can you fix it? It may be a simple
                    change, or it
                    may require a substantial rearchitecture.
                </p>

                <p>This is what I do for novel and story manuscripts. I will step through your book chapter by
                    chapter, section by
                    section, paragraph by paragraph, line by line, to identify problems and suggest solutions. I can
                    help you
                    identify plot holes, strengthen your characters, fix your pacing, and avoid logical flaws. I
                    will help you
                    debug your book and make it the best book it can be.
                </p>


                <h1 id="Services">services</h1>

                <p>I offer developmental editing of sci-fi and fantasy novels and short stories.</p>

                <p>Developmental editing, also sometimes called structural or substantive editing, is big-picture
                    editing. It
                    focuses on character development, plot, structure, world building, pacing, scene dynamics, etc.
                    This type of
                    editing is intended to strengthen and finesse the story and is typically the first phase of
                    editing. You can
                    expect to do substantial revision after receiving feedback from a developmental editor.
                </p>

                <p>There are other types of editing, which I do <em>not</em> do. Line editing focuses on the use of
                    language at
                    the sentence and paragraph level. This type of editing can benefit authors who struggle with
                    prose. Copyediting
                    focuses on grammar, punctuation, and consistency with a particular code of style. You shouldn't
                    do copyediting
                    until you're finished with major revisions.
                </p>

                <p>For an effective edit, the author, manuscript, and editor need to be a good fit for each other. I
                    focus on
                    sci-fi and fantasy because this is what I like to read, so I bring to the table substantial
                    genre expertise
                    and an inherent enthusiasm for this type of story. Intergalactic political intrigue? Aliens? FTL
                    drives? Bring
                    it on! Magic? Dragons? Oh yeah! (But, I don't do vampires, werewolves, or zombies, and I don't
                    do horror or
                    anything whose purpose is to scare. That isn't to say that stories with these things can't be
                    great stories;
                    it's just that I'm not a good fit for them.)
                </p>


                <h1 id="Deliverables">deliverables</h1>

                <p>When I do a developmental edit of your manuscript, this is what you can expect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A copy of your manuscript with thorough and comprehensive comments in the margins</li>
                    <li>A detailed editorial letter with a summary of your manuscript's strengths and weaknesses and
                        suggestions for revisions</li>
                    <li>For a novel, a book map, which is a spreadsheet breaking down the structure of your manuscript
                        scene by
                        scene. I will not provide a book map for short stories or novel chapters unless specifically
                        requested.</li>
                    <li>Optionally, a video call to discuss my edits after you've had a chance to absorb them</li>
                    <li>Optionally (and within reason), follow-up brainstorming chats if you just need to bounce
                        ideas off someone during your revisions</li>
                </ul>

                <p>My feedback will include a lot of questions. Why? My questions are intended to alert you, the
                    author, to potential
                    problems and opportunities for improvement. They're meant to get you thinking and spark ideas.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>I promise to respect your manuscript. No matter what state it's in, my goal is to help you
                        realize your intentions.
                        My criticism will be constructive, polite, encouraging, respectful, and realistic. My job is
                        not to judge, but to help.</li>
                    <li>I promise thoroughness and attention to detail. By the time we're done, I will know this
                        manuscript nearly as well as you do.</li>
                    <li>I promise to honor my commitments to you. I will finish my edits and deliver them to you
                        in a timely manner.</li>
                    <li>I promise confidentiality. Your manuscript is yours and yours alone until you're ready to
                        release it into the wild.</li>

                        <q>Melinda's thorough book debugging is truly a magical experience. We
                            began our correspondence on Critters, and since then the insights and logical questions Melinda has
                            left for my writing have greatly helped me to reshape it into something stronger, more cohesive, and
                            more sound. No stone is left unturned, and Melinda's insights have led to deeper storytelling,
                            cleaner dynamics, and helped me to understand where I was being a confused author stuck in my own
                            head. It has been an all around just a fantastic experience. It's a privilege and a pleasure to work
                            with this amazing person, and I count my stars very lucky.</q>

                            critiques for my work, often pointing out things I myself had noticed in the back of my mind, but
                            needed someone to put them in the right words and push them to the forefront. Her evaluations are
                            thorough and engaging, and never condescending. She easily identifies the story's larger intended
                            themes and points out how they might be clarified, as well as noting the smaller little details that
                            need fine tuning.</q>

                            critique
                            is likely to produce
                            an inferior product. This service is what Melinda provided for me. Apart from the slew of
                            detailed comments
                            concerning specific issues, the main benefit was her describing in some detail her perception of
                            the world and
                            characters I had created. This allowed me to see either areas where my world-building had not
                            been effective,
                            or, worse, where I had assumed the reader would take something as a given when that was maybe a
                            step too far!
                            As a result, the final version turned out, much to my surprise, to be several thousand words
                            longer than the
                            completed draft, and, I feel, a much superior book as a result. Thank you, Melinda!</q>

                <h1 id="About">about me</h1>

                <p>I've been volunteer editing and critiquing weekly on
                    <a href="https://critters.org/" target="_blank" , rel="noopener">critters.org</a> since 2020, and I
                    completed the Editorial Arts Academy's
                    <a href="https://editorialartsacademy.com/classes-events/developmental-editing-for-fiction/"
                        target="_blank" , rel="noopener">
                        Developmental Editing for Fiction</a> course in early 2022. I have edited six novels and over
                    75 short stories and novel excerpts.
                </p>

                <p>I've been a voracious reader since childhood, and pro bono editing is my way of giving back to the
                    community of authors whose wonderful creations I enjoy. I want to pay it forward and help the next
                    generation of great authors hone their skills.</p>

                <p>That said, editing is a highly skilled profession,
                    and professional editors absolutely deserve to get paid. I don't want to undercut anybody's
                    business or to undervalue their skills, which is why I don't solicit business. If you have the
                    funds,
                    please hire an editor and pay them what they're worth! But, I know that
                    in reality many authors legitimately cannot afford to hire a developmental editor, and I hope I
                    can serve some of these and help them kickstart their careers.
                </p>

                <p>When I'm not reading and editing books, I am a software engineer who develops GIS software for
                    mapping and spatial
                    analysis. Although it may not seem like software engineering and fiction editing have much in
                    common, they
                    actually do! In my job as a software engineer, I focus on the details of the user workflow,
                    figuring out how
                    someone can accomplish a task from start to finish. Both require extreme attention to detail
                    with a focus on how
                    each individual component contributes to the whole. Both require me to look at structure and
                    cause-and-effect logic.
